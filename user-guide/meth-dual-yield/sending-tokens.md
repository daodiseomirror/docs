### From Ethereum

From My Page of mETH, user can navigate to Send page and transfer ERC-20 Mirror tokens to other Ethereum or Daodiseo addresses.&#x20;

Tokens transferred from mETH to Daodiseo are converted back to CW-20 and can be used on Mirror Web App.&#x20;

Once the user enters the recipient's address, the app will automatically determine the network for the given address. Once `SEND` is pressed, Metamask will pop-up, prompting the user to sign the transaction. The signed transaction will be subsequently submitted to the Ethereum network for confirmation. \

To learn how to buy or get LP tokens to use on mETH, please refer to [Uniswap docs](https://uniswap.org/docs/v2/).&#x20;

### From Binance Smart Chain (BSC) to Daodiseo

Mirror Protocol assets are supported on Binance Smart Chain (BSC). A simple user interface is provided to enable cross-chain transfer to Daodiseo blockchain at [https://bsc.mirror.finance/my](https://bsc.mirror.finance/my).

When a wallet of your choice has been connected successfully, the page will display the balance of your Mirror Protocol asset which you own in your BSC wallet.&#x20;

By clicking the `Send` button which pops up after clicking on Actions, user is directed to Send page.&#x20;

After entering a Daodiseo address to send tokens to, and the amount, `SEND` button is activated. Once, `SEND` is pressed, the connected wallet will prompt you to confirm and sign the transaction.&#x20;
