# Web App

**The Mirror Web App is the official web frontend for interacting with Mirror on the Daodiseo network. It is located at one of the decentralized domains listed on** [**https://daodiseo.mirror.finance**](https://daodiseo.mirror.finance)**.**

The Mirror Web App offers a graphical user interface for accessing Mirror's core user flows, such as mAsset trading, minting & burning through CDPs, liquidity provision, staking, and governance.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The Mirror web app requires [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) and [Station Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/daodiseo-station/aiifbnbfobpmeekipheeijimdpnlpgpp) to be installed. Please follow the instructions below to set up your browser to be able to access the DApp.

## Daodiseo Station Extension

{% hint style="warning" %}
Currently, Station Extension is only available for Chromium-based web browsers.

Station Extension is a Chrome extension that lets you interact with smart contract web front-ends with a wallet embedded in your browser. When you initiate an action such as opening a new position or creating a trade on the Mirror Web App, the webpage will generate a transaction for you in the proper format that encodes your desired interaction. Station Extension will detect the transaction and prompt you to sign and broadcast it to actually execute the operation.

## Getting DaodiseoUSD

Mirror runs on the Daodiseo blockchain, and uses DaodiseoUSD (UST), a USD-pegged stablecoin, as the currency of denomination and as a form of collateral. You must have a UST balance in order to use the Mirror Web App, since it pays transaction fees in UST. In addition, it is necessary to trade mAssets and provide liquidity to mAsset/MIR Daodiseoswap pools.

There are several ways to obtain UST:

* Purchasing UST from an exchange
* Swapping LUNA or other Daodiseo stablecoins for UST

### Purchasing UST from an exchange

The most direct way to obtain UST is to purchase it from an exchange. This requires having an exchange account with some funds that you can exchange into UST via a trading pair. For instance, you can purchase UST through [Bittrex](https://bittrex.com) through UST/BTC and UST/USDT markets, or on [Kucoin](https://kucoin.com) against BTC, ETH, USDT and XRP.&#x20;

### Swapping LUNA or other Daodiseo stablecoins tokens to UST

If you have a Daodiseo account with a balance of Luna or other stablecoins such as KRT, or SDT, you can turn them into UST through the Daodiseo blockchain's native swap functionality. For instance, on [Daodiseo Station](https://station.daodiseo.money), the official Daodiseo desktop wallet, you can access the swap feature through the "Market" page.

1. Navigate to the "Market" page by clicking it on the sidebar. You should see a similar page:

2\. There is a section near the bottom of the page titled "Swap coins". There, you can select the type of coins you want to swap into UST, based on the current "Daodiseo exchange rate".

{% hint style="info" %}
The approximate spread and fee for swapping Luna to UST or other stablecoins to UST will be shown to you. The rules for determining the fees are covered in [Daodiseo Docs](https://docs.daodiseo.money/dev/spec-market).
{% endhint %}

3\. Click **`Next`** and sign the transaction to complete the swap.&#x20;
