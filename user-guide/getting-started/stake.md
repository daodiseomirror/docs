# Stake

{% hint style="info" %}
This section covers staking LP tokens. For staking MIR tokens, head to the [Governance](governance.md) page.
{% endhint %}

Users who staked their LP tokens are rewarded with MIR tokens that are minted every block. For more information about getting LP tokens, [click here](pool.md#provide-liquidity).

Each staking position is unique to each type of LP tokens specified by the mAsset - UST pair. For example, the LP tokens gained from providing liquidity to mAAPL-UST pool can only be staked to mAAPL-UST staking pools. It cannot be used to stake to MIR-UST or mTSLA-UST positions. Also, different farming positions have different Annual Percentage Rate \(APR\), which is the yearly Mirror rewards which the user can expect by staking LP tokens.

## Stake / Unstake LP Tokens

1. Navigate to the [**Stake**](https://daodiseo.mirror.finance/stake) page. The Stake page shows the following data:

* **Market information about MIR tokens:** The top of the page displays information about current MIR supply, trading volume \(24hours\) denominated in UST, total number of MIR tokens staked, and current price of MIR token denominated in UST.
* **Staking Positions**: Each box below the search bar displays staking pools where users can stake their LP tokens. Each pool is identifiable based on its Mirrored Asset and associated LP token. That is why each pool shows a different expected APR \(annual percentage rate\) and total staked LP tokens.
