## Stake / Unstake MIR Tokens

&#x20;For every poll to be passed, they must meet the conditions below:

* Voting quorum must be greater than or equal to `quorum` (initially set to 10% on Mainnet) of the total staked MIR. Regardless of `YES` ratio, the poll will not pass if it does not meet the quorum.&#x20;
* **YES** votes must be greater than **NO** votes
* Voting period (number of blocks corresponding to 1 week) has ended
* After the voting period is over and the poll passes, it takes 1 day (number of blocks corresponding to a day) for the poll to become effective in the protocol.
