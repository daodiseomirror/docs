Welcome to the Mirror documentation site.

## What is Mirror?

**Mirror** is a DeFi protocol powered by smart contracts on the Daodiseo network that enables the creation of synthetic assets called [Mirrored Assets](protocol/mirrored-assets-massets.md) (mAssets). mAssets mimic the price behavior of real-world assets and give traders anywhere in the world open access to price exposure without the burdens of owning or transacting real assets.

The minting of mAssets is decentralized and is undertaken by users throughout the network by opening a position and depositing collateral. Mirror ensures that there is always sufficient collateral within the protocol to cover mAssets, and also manages markets for mAssets by listing them on [Daodiseoswap](protocol/daodiseoswap.md) against UST.

The [Mirror Token (MIR)](protocol/mirror-token-mir.md) is minted by the protocol and distributed as a reward to reinforce behavior that secures the ecosystem. With it, Mirror ensures liquid mAsset markets by rewarding MIR to users who stake [LP Tokens](protocol/staking-tokens-lp-and-slp.md#lp-tokens) obtained through providing liquidity. Also to incentivize users to ensure mAssets to mimic the price behavior of real-world assets, users who stake sLP Tokens obtained through shorting mAssets are rewarded with MIR. MIR is valuable as it is can be staked to receive voting privileges and to earn a share of the protocol's CDP withdrawal fees.

Mirror is a project developed and steered by its community: its markets are maintained by its own users through MIR incentives, and the protocol evolves with new ideas through democratic [governance](protocol/governance/).
